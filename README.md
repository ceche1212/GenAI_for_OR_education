# Integrating Generative AI into Operations Research Education

This repository provides the official supplementary materials for the article, **"Integrating Generative AI into Operations Research Education: Framework, Use Cases, and Ethical Reflections."**

Here you'll find implementation code, prompt structures, and sample outputs discussed in the paper, designed to help educators and students explore the intersection of Generative AI and Operations Research.

## üìñ Repository Structure

The repository is organized to mirror the use cases and concepts presented in the article:

-   **/code**: Contains Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and other source code used for the practical implementations. This includes API calls, data processing, and model fine-tuning scripts.
-   **/prompts**: A collection of structured prompts for the different use cases discussed. Each file is named according to its corresponding application (e.g., `formulation_assistant.txt`, `solver_code_generation.txt`).
-   **/outputs**: Includes sample outputs generated by the AI models from the prompts. This section serves as a benchmark and an example of what can be achieved (e.g., `cvrp_formulation_output.json`, `knapsack_python_code.py`).
-   **/paper**: A pre-print or final version of the article for easy reference.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the code and examples in this repository, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    The required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Add API Keys (if applicable):**
    Some scripts may require API keys (e.g., for OpenAI). Follow the instructions in the specific code files, which usually involve creating a `.env` file and adding your key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Reflections

As discussed in the article, the use of Generative AI in education comes with important ethical considerations. We encourage users to reflect on issues of academic integrity, algorithmic bias, and the responsible application of these powerful tools.
